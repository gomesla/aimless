## CRISP DM: Business Understanding
### Business Objective
Our goal is to:
- First find a model that best predicts whether a user will sign up for a long term deposit after several contacts from a marketing campaign.
- Second use the model to explain what features contribute most significantly to the outcome of user signing up for a deposit.
- Lastly use this information to offer guidance to the bank on which customers to target based on features or approach so we can minimize resources, time and thus cost and maximize the desired result.
